       "- Core AI technologies already exist (NLP, recommendation systems, automated agents).\n",
       "- Data sources are abundant (job sites, LinkedIn, industry reports).\n",
       "- Ethical and privacy protocols can be established to protect users.\n",
       "- A phased rollout can begin with less sensitive tasks (resume building, job matching) and expand to more agentic functions (interactions with recruiters).\n",

       "- There is no effective method to track and refine career plans dynamically based on real outcomes.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 6. **Accessibility and Inclusion Gaps**\n",
